            <p>The City of Somerville is home to around 80,000 residents. These residents occupy over two-thirds of the city’s land area of 4.2 square miles, while commercial, industrial, and municipal uses account for the remainder. The city is served by Eversource for all its electricity needs, while both Eversource and National Grid are responsible for providing natural gas service. An analysis of Somerville’s 2014 energy use by sector (Figure 1) shows the residential (52%) and C&ampI (45%) sectors to be the two highest consumers of energy.
            </p>
            <p>The city consumes almost 5 million MMBTUs of energy on an annual basis, which amounts to over 761 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, 53% of the emissions are caused from natural gas use, while electricity use accounts for 46%. Despite natural gas being a cleaner fuel source, its contribution to higher carbon emissions is primarily because Somerville consumed around 3.4 million MMBTUs of natural gas compared to just 1.4 million MMBTUs of electricity.</p>
            <div id="communityEfforts" class="subGroup">
            <h3>Community Efforts</h3>
              <h4>Goals, Plans, and Visions</h4>
              <p>Through the creation of the SomerVision Comprehensive Plan (2010 - 2030), the City of Somerville has demonstrated its commitment to viewing various aspects of the community’s future through the lens of sustainability. The Plan, adopted by Somerville Planning Board in April 2012, serves as a guide for the city for future growth and development. Several of Somerville’s goals relating to resources, transportation, and infrastructure identify energy efficiency as a sustainable and effective strategy for the community.</p>
              <h4>Green Communities Designation</h4>
              <p>Somerville’s designation as a Green Community in 2011 is further evidence of the City’s long-term energy and environmental strategy commitments. The designation involved the satisfaction of five progressive energy-related criteria, such as streamlining the permitting process for renewable energy projects and creating an energy reduction plan to reduce municipal energy consumption by 20%. Somerville was also provided with significant funding to implement municipal energy efficiency projects across the city’s portfolio of municipal properties. Since its designation in 2011, the City has received over $360,000 in grant funding for projects including rooftop solar assessments, LED streetlight retrofits, Energy Management System upgrades, and EV charging stations.</p>
              <h4>Net-Zero Commitment and Greenhouse Gas Inventories</h4>
              <p>In 2014, Somerville’s Mayor Curtatone announced a commitment to achieve net zero energy use in city buildings by 2050. The setting of such an ambitious carbon neutrality target was enabled thanks to the city’s enduring efforts in measuring greenhouse gas emissions. In 2001, a municipal greenhouse gas inventory was completed, and led to the passage of a resolution to reduce city emissions 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2015. The city is currently in the process of developing a community-wide emissions inventory with the goal of supporting future energy and climate decisions.</p>
              <h4>Honeywell Energy Performance Contract</h4>
              <p>Somerville also entered into a $7.8 million energy savings performance contract with Honeywell as a mechanism to fund deep energy retrofits in municipal facilities. In just three years, the City has already saved over $476,000 through reduced utility bills, with annual savings guaranteed until 2029. Additionally, through Honeywell’s ‘Act!Earth’ program, the city is able to take advantage of energy monitoring, data and education to effectively alter the way buildings are used and operated in order to reduce their energy use.</p>
              <h4>LED Streetlight Conversion</h4>
              <p>Somerville is currently in the process of converting every City-owned streetlight and other light fixtures to energy-efficient LED lightbulbs. The City is investing close to $2.5 million in this technology, and will see that amount payed back in around five years. The LED fixtures will help Somerville reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 600 metric tons annually.</p>
              <h4>Residential Energy Efficiency</h4>
              <p>Somerville’s residential energy efficiency program was a joint initiative between Somerville’s Housing Division, OSE, and Commission on Energy and Climate Change. Designed to address energy efficiency in multi-family and rental units, the program ran from November 2011 through Dec 2012 and resulted in 560 homes audited; $96,000 in incentives delivered to 73 homes; and between 55 and 72 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduced annually. </p>

            <h2>Municipal Energy Profile</h2><p>Somerville monitors its municipal energy data using the MassEnergyInsight (MEI) tool. MEI is a free, web-based tool developed by Peregrine Energy Group and made available to cities and towns in Massachusetts through the Department of Energy Resources (DOER) as part of the Massachusetts Green Communities Program. Electricity and natural gas usage for Somerville’s municipal accounts is pre-loaded by Eversource into the MEI program. Other fuel use data (such as heating oil and vehicle fuel) must be manually entered and kept up-to-date by Somerville municipal staff. Somerville’s municipal sector accounts for approximately 3% of the City’s total energy consumption.

              <h3>Municipal Fuel Mix</h3>
              <p>The City of Somerville uses a variety of energy sources for its electricity, heating, cooling, and transportation needs. In calendar year 2014, over 161,000 MMBTUs were expended for municipal purposes. Figure 3 below illustrates that this energy demand was met primarily through electricity and natural gas, which accounted for 34% and 30% respectively of Somerville’s energy mix.</p>
              <div class="row chartSpace">
                  <div id="chart2" class="col-md-6"></div>
                  <div id="chart3" class="col-md-6"></div>
              </div>
              <p>Somerville also relied on oil to generate 32,000 MMBTUs of energy for heating its municipal facilities, which amounts to 20% of the city’s fuel mix. Gasoline and diesel, primarily used as fuel for the municipal vehicle fleet, together accounted for around 16% of the city’s energy mix. Comparing the carbon emissions from these fuel sources paints a slightly different picture (Figure 4). Natural gas is rich in methane, which has a higher energy content compared to other fuel sources, and thus contributes to a lower CO<sub>2</sub>-to-energy content. Despite accounting for 30% of municipal energy use, natural gas is responsible for just 19% of municipal carbon emissions. Electricity, on the other hand, is responsible for the majority (51%) of emissions from municipal energy use. Diesel and fuel oil also have comparatively high emissions levels per unit of energy generated, and together account for around 21% of carbon emissions. The municipal fuel and carbon emissions mix for Somerville implies that it will be highly beneficial for the City to focus its efforts on increasing energy efficiency for equipment that consumes large amounts electricity in its facilities, and explore the conversion of oil- and diesel-fueled equipment to more efficient natural-gas-powered equipment.</p>
              <p>The table and graph below show a breakdown of energy use by fuel type for each department in the City of Somerville. Most departments use an even split of electricity and natural gas for their energy needs. The Schools department consumes the highest amount of energy annually, around 82,134 MMBTUs. More than 25% of this consumption is through fuel oil. It is also worth noting that the Schools department accounts for almost 70% of the entire City’s annual oil consumption.</p>

              <p>Based on this information, it is advisable for Somerville to prioritize the Schools for energy efficiency upgrades. The City’s school buildings account for more than half of overall municipal energy consumption. Combined with a reliance on fuel oil for heating purposes, the implication is that there exists significant potential for reducing energy usage through smarter fuel choices and energy-efficient equipment. </p>

              <p>Municipal buildings make up approximately 72% of Somerville’s municipal energy use, as illustrated in the chart above. Vehicle fuel in the form of diesel and gasoline accounts for almost 15% of annual energy use, while streetlights use almost 8%. The Somerville High School is the largest consumer of energy in the city, using over 31,000 MMBTUs on an annual basis.  The High School is also the largest municipal facility in Somerville at over 415,000 square feet, resulting in an energy use intensity (EUI) of only 75 kBTU/sf.  This places the facility as one of the more energy-efficient in the city’s portfolio.</p> 
              <p>The Union Square Fire Station is the second-largest user of energy, consuming 19,055 MMBTUs annually. With a gross floor area of just 87,500 square feet, however, this results in the second-highest EUI in the city of 218 kBTU/sf.  A list of all municipal facilities and their respective Energy Use Intensities can be viewed in the table below.</p>

              <p>An analysis of energy use intensity by department reveals that there is a significant difference between the performances of facilities under various departments. Fire stations in Somerville have the highest average energy use intensity at around 207 kBTU per square foot. In comparison, administrative buildings have consumed about 71 kBTUs per square foot. The difference in energy use intensity is due to the primary use type of the facilities in Somerville’s portfolio. Fire stations and other public safety buildings typically operate on a 24 hour basis, and include garage spaces that may be air-conditioned yet exposed to outside weather conditions frequently. Administrative buildings are on shorter and more regular operational schedules, which could explain their lower energy use intensities.</p>

              <p>The majority of Somerville’s municipal facilities fall above the Massachusetts state average energy use intensity of 64 kBTU/sf for municipal buildings. This seems to indicate that there is potential for energy efficiency improvements across the entire portfolio of buildings. Moving away from inefficient fuel types such as oil and propane could also contribute towards reducing the energy use intensity of certain facilities.</p>

            <p>Over 75% of Somerville’s housing stock comprises of multi-family units, with 2-4 multi-family units alone accounting for almost 60% of available housing. This profile is almost exactly an inverse of what is seen in the rest of the state, where single-family units make up around 76% of the housing stock. Additionally, over 67% of the available housing units in Somerville are occupied by renters, compared to a state average of 23%.</p>
            <h3 id="resiEnerCons">Residential Energy Consumption</h3>
            <p>The residential sector makes up approximately 52% of the energy consumption in Somerville. In the year 2014, Somerville residents consumed around 150 million kWh of electricity and over 20 million therms of natural gas. The resulting greenhouse gas emissions from these two energy sources amounted to over 363 million pounds of CO<sub>2</sub>, with emissions from natural gas usage almost twice the amount from electricity usage.</p>

            <p>Electricity use in Somerville has generally followed a downward trend. Between 2010 and 2014, annual electricity consumption was reduced by almost 8 million kWh. This reduction coincides with an increase of around in the number of residential electric accounts from 31,634 to 32,433. On average, residential electricity use on a per-customer basis dropped by 7.4% between 2010 and 2014, indicating that the City’s efforts to incentivize and promote energy efficiency improvements through state-level programs have made a positive impact so far.</p>
            <div class="chartspace">
              <div id="chart7"></div>
            </div>
            <p>It is encouraging to observe that despite a high percentage of renters, Somerville residents have been steadily decreasing their consumption of electricity over the past few years. However, a low percentage of owner-occupied housing units does imply that it may be challenging for the City to promote renewable energy adoption such as roof-top solar. It may be beneficial for Somerville to explore the development and promotion of community shared solar as an option for the renter-heavy residential population. 
            </p>
            <p>Natural gas usage, on the other hand, generally saw an increase over the past few years. Between 2012 and 2014, annual natural gas consumption in the residential sector increased from around 15.5 million therms to over 20 million therms.</p>
            <p>Converting both electric and natural gas usage from their native units to MMBTUs offered a more direct comparison between the two sources. In 2014, the average household in Somerville consumed 15.79 MMBTU of electricity and 77.30 MMBTU of natural gas. While the electricity usage represents a reduction of 4.1% compared to 2012, natural gas usage increased by 23.6% over the same period.</p>

            <p>With natural gas accounting for more than 80% of the energy used on average in a Somerville household, the total average energy use increased by 17.8% between 2012 and 2014. While some of the increase for natural gas consumption could be attributed to weather-related circumstances, there still exists potential for implementing energy-efficiency programs to reduce residential natural gas consumption.</p>

            <p>Somerville businesses have consistently been increasing their electricity consumption. In the five-year period between 2010 and 2014, C&ampI sector electricity usage went up by almost 40 million kWh. Accounting for the increase in customer accounts, this represented an 8.6% increase during that period. </p>

            <p>Natural gas consumption was also analyzed for the three-year period between 2012 and 2014; Somerville businesses increased their annual usage from 11.6 million therms to 14.2 million therms during this time.</p> 
            <p>A comparison of electricity and natural gas consumption converted from their respective native units to MMBTUs reveals that the average Somerville business consumed 165 MMBTU of electricity and 894 MMBTU of natural gas in the year 2014. This represents a 3.2% increase and a 23.4% increase respectively from 2012 usage.</p>
            <div class="chartspace">
              <div id="chart10"></div>
            </div>
            <p>Additionally, in keeping with the residential consumption profile, Somerville’s businesses used natural gas for over 84% of their overall energy needs. The reliance on natural gas, coupled with the general increase in overall energy use for the past three years, implies that the C&ampI sector could benefit significantly from structured energy programs – ideally as a collaboration between the City and the utilities – with incentives to reduce energy consumption and invest in energy efficiency upgrades.  </p>
